I also want to thank Pinchy, Mugwump, Len and PalmliX for their help with bug hunting. I apologize if I am forgetting anyone else who assisted.

A special thank you to Ian “iw” Walshaw for his excellent coding, detailed comments and for fixing a massive list of bugs starting with version 1.1.1 

Simply put, progs_dump would not have been as stable and ambitious without him.
